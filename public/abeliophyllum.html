          <strong>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</strong> is a monotypic genus of flowering
          plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,<strong> Abeliophyllum distichum</strong>
          Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to
          Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.</p>
        <p>It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to
          4.5 cm wide, pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new leaves
          appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round,
          winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.</p>
        <p>It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.</p>
